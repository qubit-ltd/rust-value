# Rust CI Scripts

[中文](README.zh_CN.md)

Shared scripts and CircleCI configuration for checking Rust code in CI.

## Files

- `align-ci.sh`: local auto-fix script for formatting and clippy.
- `ci-check.sh`: local full CI parity check.
- `coverage.sh`: local coverage report generator and threshold checker.
- `.circleci/config.yml`: optimized CircleCI template.

## Recommended Adoption

Copy these files into the root of a Rust project:

```bash
command cp align-ci.sh ci-check.sh coverage.sh <project-root>/
command cp .circleci/config.yml <project-root>/.circleci/config.yml
```

Then run:

```bash
cd <project-root>
chmod +x align-ci.sh ci-check.sh coverage.sh
./ci-check.sh
```

## Tunable Environment Variables

- `RUST_TOOLCHAIN`: toolchain used for `fmt` and `clippy`; defaults to `nightly`.
- `RS_CI_PROJECT_ROOT`: Rust project root used when these scripts are run from another directory.
- `RUN_COVERAGE_CFG_CLIPPY`: set to `1` to run clippy with `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg coverage"`.
- `COVERAGE_ENFORCE_THRESHOLDS`: set to `0` to disable per-source coverage thresholds; defaults to `1`.
- `MIN_FUNCTION_COVERAGE`: per-source function coverage threshold; defaults to `100`.
- `MIN_LINE_COVERAGE`: per-source line coverage threshold; defaults to `95`, interpreted as `> 95`.
- `MIN_REGION_COVERAGE`: per-source region coverage threshold; defaults to `95`, interpreted as `> 95`.
- `COVERAGE_SOURCE_DIR`: source directory checked by per-source thresholds; defaults to `src`.
- `COVERAGE_EXTRA_EXCLUDE_REGEX`: extra regex alternation appended to the coverage exclude pattern.
- `COVERAGE_OPEN_HTML`: set to `0` to stop `coverage.sh html` from opening the browser.

## Notes

The scripts are intentionally self-contained so Rust projects can keep familiar
root-level command names. Project-specific behavior should be configured with
environment variables instead of editing the scripts for one project only.
